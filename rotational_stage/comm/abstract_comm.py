    ## INITIALIZER ##
    
    def __init__(self):
        self._debug = False
        
        # Create a new logger for the module containing the concrete
        # subclass that we're a part of.
        self._logger = logging.getLogger(type(self).__module__)
        
        # Ensure that there's at least something setup to receive logs.

    ## FORMATTING METHODS ##
    
    def __repr__(self):
        return "<{} object at 0x{:X} "\
                "connected to {}>".format(type(self).__name__, id(self), repr(self.address))
    
    ## CONCRETE PROPERTIES ##
    
    @property
    def debug(self):
        """
        Enables or disables debug support. If active, all messages sent to
        or received from this communicator are logged to the Python logging
        service, with the logger name given by the module of the current
        communicator.
        Generating log messages for each exchanged command is slow, so these
        log messages are suppressed by default.
        
        Note that you must turn on logging to at least the DEBUG level in order
        to see these messages. For instance:
        
        >>> import logging
        >>> logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

        Reads or changes the current address for this communicator.

    def terminator(self):

    def _sendcmd(self, msg):
        '''
        Sends a message to the connected device, handling all proper
        termination characters and secondary commands as required.
        
        Note that this is called by :class:`AbstractCommunicator.sendcmd`,
        which also handles debug, event and capture support.

    @abc.abstractmethod    
    def _query(self, msg, size=-1):
        '''
        Send a string to the connected instrument using sendcmd and read the
        response. This is an abstract method because there are situations where
        information contained in the sent command is needed for reading logic.
        
        An example of this is the Galvant Industries GPIB adapter where if
        you are connected to an older instrument and the query command does not
        contain a `?`, then the command `+read` needs to be send to force the
        instrument to send its response.

        by the communication.

        the communication channel without appending other data.
