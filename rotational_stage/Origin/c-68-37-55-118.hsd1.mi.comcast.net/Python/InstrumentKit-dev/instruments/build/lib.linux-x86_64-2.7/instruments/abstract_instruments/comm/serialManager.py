'''
This module handles creating the serial objects for the instrument classes.

This is needed for Windows because only 1 serial object can have an open
connection to a serial port at a time. This is not needed on Linux, as multiple 
pyserial connections can be open at the same time to the same serial port.

## IMPORTS #####################################################################

import serial

from instruments.abstract_instruments.comm import SerialWrapper

# We want to only *weakly* hold references to serial ports, to allow for them
# to be deleted and reopened as need be.
import weakref

## GLOBALS #####################################################################

# Note that a WeakValueDictionary *will* delete entries when their values
# no longer exist. As a consequence, great care must be taken when iterating
# over the dictionary in any way.
# See http://docs.python.org/2/library/weakref.html#weakref.WeakValueDictionary
# for more details about what "great care" implies.
serialObjDict = weakref.WeakValueDictionary()
