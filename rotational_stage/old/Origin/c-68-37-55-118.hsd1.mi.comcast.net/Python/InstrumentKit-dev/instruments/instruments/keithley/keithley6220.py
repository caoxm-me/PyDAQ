class Keithley6220(SCPIInstrument, PowerSupply):
    """
    The Keithley 6220 is a single channel constant current supply.
    
    Because this is a constant current supply, most features that a regular
    power supply have are not present on the 6220.
    
    Example usage:
    
    >>> import quantities as pq
    >>> import instruments as ik
    >>> ccs = ik.keithley.Keithley6220.open_gpibusb('/dev/ttyUSB0', 10)
    >>> ccs.current = 10 * pq.milliamp # Sets current to 10mA
    >>> ccs.disable() # Turns off the output and sets the current to 0A

    ## PROPERTIES ##
    
    @property
    def channel(self):
        """
        For most power supplies, this would return a channel specific object.
        However, the 6220 only has a single channel, so this function simply
        returns a tuple containing itself. This is for compatibility reasons
        if a multichannel supply is replaced with the single-channel 6220.
        
        For example, the following commands are the same and both set the 
        current to 10mA:
        
        >>> ccs.channel[0].current = 0.01
        >>> ccs.current = 0.01
