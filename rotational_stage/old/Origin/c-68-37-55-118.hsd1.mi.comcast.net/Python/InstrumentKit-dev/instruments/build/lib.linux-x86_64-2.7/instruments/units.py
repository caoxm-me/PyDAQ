## SPECIFIC UNITS ##

# Define basic unit of log-power, the dBm.

#: Decibel-milliwatts, a basic unit of logarithmic power.

# The Phase Matrix signal generators communicate in units of millihertz (mHz)
# and centibel-milliwatts (cBm). We define those units here to make conversions
# easier later on.

# TODO: move custom units out to another module.
