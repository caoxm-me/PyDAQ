class HP6652a(PowerSupply, PowerSupplyChannel):
    """
    The HP6652a is a single output power supply.

    Because it is a single channel output, this object inherits from both
    PowerSupply and PowerSupplyChannel.

    According to the manual, this class MIGHT be usable for any HP power supply
    with a model number HP66XYA, where X is in {4,5,7,8,9} and Y is a digit(?).
    (e.g. HP6652A and HP6671A)

    HOWEVER, it has only been tested by the author with an HP6652A power supply.
    
    Example usage:

    >>> import time
    >>> import instruments as ik
    >>> psu = ik.hp.HP6652a.open_serial('/dev/ttyUSB0', 57600)
    >>> psu.voltage = 3 # Sets output voltage to 3V.
    >>> psu.output = True
    >>> psu.voltage
    array(3.0) * V
    >>> psu.voltage_sense < 5
    True
    >>> psu.output = False
    >>> psu.voltage_sense < 1
    True
    >>> psu.display_textmode=True
    >>> psu.display_text("test GOOD")
    'TEST GOOD'
    >>> time.sleep(5)
    >>> psu.display_textmode=False

        15 (counting the possible use of punctuation), the text will
        be truncated to 15 characters before the command is sent to
        the instrument.

        If an invalid string is sent, the command will fail silently.
        Any lowercase letters in the text_to_display will be converted
        to uppercase before the command is sent to the instrument.

        No attempt to validate punctuation is currently made.

        Because the string cannot be read back from the instrument,
        this method returns the actual string value sent.
