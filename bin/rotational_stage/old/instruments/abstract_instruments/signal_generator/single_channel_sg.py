class SingleChannelSG(SignalGenerator, SGChannel):
    """
    Class for representing a Signal Generator that only has a single output
    channel. The sole property in this class allows for the user to use the API
    for SGs with multiple channels and a more compact form since it only has 
    one output.
    
    For example, both of the following calls would work the same:
    
    >>> print sg.channel[0].freq # Multi-channel style
    >>> print sg.freq # Compact style
